# dotfiles
Dotfiles for my current rice. 

## TODO:
- Colours don't match across applications - for instance, dunst, kitty, code, all have different purple themes.
- Terminal colours aren't great, need to change them to match the background.
- NES = Not Enough Shortcuts!
- Make the README nice and representative before switching rices
